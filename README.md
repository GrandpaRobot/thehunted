# Places to look
Most of our information regarding the mod can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/GrandpaRobot/thehunted/wiki). This includes how to contribute, what kind of mod this is and what we are hoping to achieve.   

Additionally, feel free to look at the [open issues](https://github.com/GrandpaRobot/thehunted/issues) if you would like to contribute. Or contribute to the discussions about the game design [here](https://github.com/GrandpaRobot/thehunted/discussions).

This is early development, so take it a bit easy on us. We've never modded before, so this is a learning experience with a hope to create something new and cool.
