##Core Ideas

* Building multi blocks is awesome - makes you feel like a wizard and get a cool end product
    * Multi blocks - but somehow still customizable by the player so they’re still individual - would be cool. 
* Starts self-contained and ignorant of other mods. Should be able to be used only in vanilla, but also should not incorporate the kitchen sink (at least to start). 
  * So many mods already add things like farms/transport/factories/automation that players will have 15 different ways to do the same thing. That’s boring.
  * Need to find unique things for these multi blocks to do.
* Should have a sense of danger - both in the style of Vault Hunters(lose gear!) and Thaumcraft (science experiment gone wrong and world is eaten)
* Should have an overarching storyline - Thaumcraft did this, but failed to deliver at the end imo
* Should have some form of repeatable gameplay - like Vault Hunters
* Should have assistants - like Thaumcraft golems
* Should have someway to allow specialization on MP servers (so individual players feel like they have roles - this increases engagement, camaraderie and good feelings)
But this can not lock single players out from doing everything the mod has to offer
* Needs some puzzles
* Needs to look cool
  
##What I want
I want the “magic”, discovery and story of Thaumcraft mixed with the treadmill of Vault Hunters and the the design of a Techarium/Create. Antiquated futuristic is an interesting genre. 

##Story
####_THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF PROOF OF CONCEPT MILESTONE_
Inter dimensional **BOUNTY HUNTERS** spawn near **PORTALS** who drop a **DIVINING ROD** that points to the CABIN of the hunted. This cabin will hold secrets which begin the player on the path in this mod pack. When first discovering the cabin, players might notice the door has been kicked in, muddy footprints litter the inside and notes have been scattered at the players’ feet. At second glance, the cabin will hint at the identity of the owner - a well traveled adventurer(**TARGET**), with bits from the End, the Nether, Ocean monuments etc. On the surface will seem like just a well maintained house that a player might construct as a basic survival house. It will have farms and other supplies a typical adventurer might have in their first major house. The **TARGET** clearly wants to be hidden and self-sustaining.
As the player reads the hastily scribbled notes, they will be mostly confusing revelations which only become apparent as you progress in the mod (some OH YEAH! moments later where you go back and look at the notes would be cool). But some of these notes will hint at the secret the bounty hunters were looking for - a hidden door triggered by a series of redstone puzzles.
Should the player find their way down into the secret chamber, they will be greeted with a portal room which contains a boarded up nether portal, an end portal with a node missing (but all the nodes full of eyes) and another defunct portal which is new and unrecognized. There will be high end gear down here (some netherite, diamond, etc - by the time the player is able to kill the bounty hunters to then find their way to the house they will most likely already be in similar gear but this will be a pleasant nice-to-have). But in one unassuming chest lies the true treasure, the exact right components and instructions for their very first custom **THE HUNTED** block.

#####*{Continue here with the actual meat of the mod}*

#####Late Game
Super late game will allow the players to actually build the portal they found and that will transport them to TARGET’s main world that he was separated from but could not find a way back to without tipping off the BOUNTY HUNTERS. This will be a very similar feel to overworld, except allow players access to more resources, some rare resources only available in this dimension. Villages will be changed and look slightly different/more advanced and there will be custom villagers who deal in THE HUNTED mod items. 

####Questions:
* Is HUNTED alive or dead? Should he not be in his cabin, but you find his notes? Maybe he’s in hiding somewhere - has a chance to spawn at a certain y in a tiny hole by himself?
Maybe mod eventually has a way to resurrect him via tech/magic
* Who is the big baddy?
  
###The “Vaults”
Have different roles for each vault - optimize for 4 players, but can adapt to more or fewer players. Players select roles before entering - adventurer, builder, combat, {?}. Players teleport into the vault(epic moment with players all in a line). In front of them is a statue with their role and a chest with initial goodies. 
####The Roles:
**Adventurer**
The goal is to find resources for the rest of the team. Will find chests, ore or whatever other resources for the team to use back in base. 
They can also find {?} that will help them back in the overworld if the team survives
**Builder**
The builder’s goal is to build a contraption that does a certain thing. This will be engineering based, so somehow a mix of redstone and mod blocks to achieve a goal.
Any devices they don’t use and dependent on the speed of their build will give them those objects on return to the overworld.
**Combat**
The combat specialist’s goal is to protect the builder from the waves of mobs trying to destroy the build
Mobs will drop items for the combat specialist to bring home
